* git log --oneline --graph
* git checkout [branch name] (switches HEAD to the branch name)
* git fetch (update local branch to match latest from server)
* git merge [branch name] (merges changes from branch name to HEAD)
* git branch -d [branch name] (deletes branch name if all changes have been merged)
* git push (pushes changes to github for current branch, use --all for multiple branches)
* git push origin :[branch name] (deletes a remote branch that was deleted locally first and tracked)
